Chronochess is the chess game of the future, and the past, and also the present sometimes. A variant on the ubiquitous chess, and the slightly nerdier 3D chess, Chronochess gives your pieces the ability to move through time just like a third spatial dimension. It also gives the player the ability to get a headache trying to figure out how to resolve the paradoxes they create while doing so. A clever opponent can intentionally cause paradoxes in their opponent's time loops to make them go from cutting through time like butter to getting their forces cut in half. 

The early access will likely be released sometime in August 2017 and will feature local and online multiplayer, a ranked matchmaking system, and hopefully a botmatch option; but for those who simply can't wait that long to be called "that weird guy who never shuts up about some time thingy," the Chronochess open alpha, featuring two tutorials, local multiplayer, and a (probably very useful) bug report feature, will be made publicly availible for download in January. Stay tuned here for updates regarding release dates and a link to the open alpha.
